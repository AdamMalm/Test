Dear [Your Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As your supervisor, I wanted to check in with you and 
get an update on the three tasks I assigned to you last week. Specifically, I am interested 
in the progress you have made on the test for price calculation, bug fixing for the twoSum 
function, and developing the stock price function.

Can you please provide me with an update on the following:

    Test for price calculation: Have you completed the testing for the price 
    calculation feature that was assigned to you? If not, what are the remaining 
    tasks and what is the estimated timeline for completion?

    Bug fixing for the twoSum function: Have you identified and fixed the bugs 
    in the twoSum function? If not, what is the current status of the debugging 
    process?

    Developing the stock price function: Have you made any significant progress 
    in developing the function? If so, please provide a brief summary of the work 
    done so far.

Please provide me with a comprehensive update on each of these tasks by eod.
If you require any support or assistance from the team, please do not hesitate 
to reach out.

I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,
[Supervisor's Name]
